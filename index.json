The subjects are provided by the TAs. The subject of these written assignments can be either: (a) student answer to a question that has been suggested by the TA on each lecture’s required reading; or (b), an opinion piece on a topic of his/her choice related to the lecture’s required reading. In either case, they are expected to state a thesis up front, discuss why their reader should care about the topic they’ve chosen, and argue in favor of it. A book report or other type of non-critical summary is not acceptable. These assignments are to be completed individually and in their own words.\nBecause 500 words is very short their written argument should be concise and punchy, and be high on content and opinion. It will take some time to compose one possible strategy is to write a 1000 word piece and edit it down to 500 words so that they are left with only the essential argument.\nProjects: Each group have 4 projects to have getting done and presented into the TA sessions. The topics will be provided by the TAs and are related to the lecture topics.\nPapers: There are papers will be assigned to all groups and they have to present them in the TA sessions. For each paper they must write a referee report. The papers are assigned by the course instructor himself.\nProposal/Project: Each student should write a proposal on Development, or do a research project based on the course references.\nContent Find the course material; essays, papers and projects here.\nUseful Material: Writting Essay Software NBER Lecture Videos ","date":1664496000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664496000,"objectID":"024f0632e0860aa32af9a7662c37be45","permalink":"https://alibahramisani.github.io/project/deecon/","publishdate":"2022-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deecon/","section":"project","summary":"Development Economics I","tags":["teaching"],"title":"Development Economics I","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" You can find your grades HERE.

Investigating the impact of this policy on the evolution of prices using the instrumented differences-in-differences approach, we see a 105% increase in price indexes in 12 months and a 52% increase in 6 months. Examining this policy’s welfare consequences via a static representative agent model, we find a welfare loss amounting to 4 Kg drop in consumption.\nFind the text and presentations bellow\nUnder The Tyranny of a Policy Presentation\nUnder The Tyrrany of a Policy Report\n","date":1656547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656547200,"objectID":"89b35de9d99b2a109f4a71a97da7686f","permalink":"https://alibahramisani.github.io/project/exchange-rate-shock/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/exchange-rate-shock/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluating the impact of subsidized exchange rate on the evolution of prices and its welfare consequences","tags":["note"],"title":"Exchange rate subsidy under the Rouhani administration","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Instrumented DD Sally Hudson, Peter Hull, and Jack Liebersohn; Interpreting Instrumented Difference-in-Differences\nClement de Chaisemartin; A note on instrumented difference in differences\n","date":1656547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656547200,"objectID":"09750e3d721024f5b4591114a67b81c5","permalink":"https://alibahramisani.github.io/project/ddiv/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ddiv/","section":"project","summary":"DDIV","tags":["material"],"title":"Instrumented DD","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Iran Datasets You can find cleaning codes in my github page as follows:\nHousehold Expenditure and Income Survey\nHousing\n","date":1656547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656547200,"objectID":"53f750f24231689d8a1e5583eb8a4c4a","permalink":"https://alibahramisani.github.io/project/irandata/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/irandata/","section":"project","summary":"Stata cleaning codes of Iran public datasets.","tags":["material"],"title":"Iran Public Datasets Cleaning Codes in Stata","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rThis is a work by Ali Naghizadeh, Ali Bahrami Sani, and Morteza Mohandes Mojarrad.\nThe datasets behind the map are public datasets such as Household Expenditure and Income Survey \u0026amp; 2% public sample of Refah dataset wich are available on the web.\r","date":1656547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656547200,"objectID":"b494fcec6ac7f73ff025055bfb72e484","permalink":"https://alibahramisani.github.io/project/iranography/iranography/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/iranography/iranography/","section":"project","summary":"Iranian socio-economic status","tags":["note"],"title":"Iranography","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Causal Inference using Stata, R and Python\nThe Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality The Effect: YouTube Stata\nMicroeconometrics Using Stata\nMitchell, M. 2022.
