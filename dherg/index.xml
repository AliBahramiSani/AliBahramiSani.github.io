&lt;h3 id=&#34;dherg&#34;&gt;DHERG&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Interdisciplinary Research Group on Development, Health, and Environmental Economics. Our group comprises a unique blend of researchers and scholars who are passionate about understanding and addressing the complex challenges at the intersection of development, health, and environmental economics. This is a platform that allows anyone to apply administrative data to address issues in the fields specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to conduct rigorous research that contributes to the global understanding of these interconnected fields. We believe that the key to sustainable development lies in the synergy of these areas. By studying them together, we aim to provide holistic solutions that consider the economic, health, and environmental aspects of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;our-topics&#34;&gt;Our Topics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Development Economics, we focus on understanding the economic aspects of developing countries and how to promote sustainable economic growth. This includes studying topics such as income distribution, poverty reduction, and the role of policy in economic development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Health Economics, we analyze the functioning of healthcare systems and the impact of health policies. We aim to understand how resources are allocated in the healthcare sector and how this affects the health outcomes of populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Environmental Economics, we study the economic impacts of environmental policies and the role of the economy in shaping our environment. This includes research on topics such as climate change, natural resource management, and the environmental natural disasters impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we strive to create a healthier, more prosperous, and sustainable world. We welcome collaboration and believe in the power of shared knowledge to drive progress. Join us as we explore the fascinating intersection of development, health, and environmental economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-availability-and-access&#34;&gt;Data availability and access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The datasets that we have used and generated in this research are stored and managed in a secure and ethical manner. We are happy to share our data with other researchers who are interested in our topics and have a valid research purpose. If you want to know more about our data sources, types, formats, and quality, please send us an email with your name, affiliation, and research question. We will respond to your request as soon as possible and provide you with the necessary information and instructions on how to access our data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;collaborating&#34;&gt;Collaborating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in joining our research group, we invite you to send us your proposals. Please include your CV, a brief summary of your research interests, background, and goals. We will review your proposals and select the most promising ones for further discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will then set up a meeting to introduce you to our data and the current projects we are working on. Our data consists of various sources of economic, health, and environmental indicators from different countries and regions. We use advanced methods of data analysis and econometrics to conduct our research.&lt;/p&gt;
